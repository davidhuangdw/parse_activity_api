  body: "By: E.\nPretty sure a few days ago there was a post that showed, using hard
    data, that SF housing rents could be explained by just three things: \n “It’s
    a chart that almost perfectly predicts the San Francisco housing market using
    only three variables: \n 1. The number of jobs located in San Francisco County.
    \n2. The number of places in San Francisco County for people to live. \n3. The
    total amount of money that is paid to everyone who works jobs in San Francisco
    County.” \n Michael Andersen: A guy just transcribed 30 years of for-rent ads.
    Here’s what it taught us about housing prices \n https://medium.com/@andersem/a-guy-just-transcribed-30-years-of-for-rent-ads-heres-what-it-taught-us-about-sf-housing-prices-bd61fd0e4ef9#.6tbfslnnd "
